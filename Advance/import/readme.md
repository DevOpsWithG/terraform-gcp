Exactly ‚Äî that‚Äôs a great observation, and you can do **the same thing in GCP** too.

That AWS example you saw is the **minimal import pattern**, and it works the same way for **any Terraform provider**, including Google Cloud.

Let me show you how that translates to GCP.

---

## üß© Minimal Import Pattern for GCP

### **1. Create an empty resource block**

You don‚Äôt need to define the full configuration first.
Just declare the resource with the right type and name.

Example ‚Äî for a Compute Engine VM:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "existing_vm" {
  # Configuration will be populated after import
}
```

---

### **2. Run the import command**

Use the GCP-specific ID format for the resource you want to import.

Example:

```bash
terraform init
terraform import google_compute_instance.existing_vm projects/<PROJECT_ID>/zones/<ZONE>/instances/<INSTANCE_NAME>
```

For example:

```bash
sagarganesh511@gcp-terraform-practice:~/gcp-terraform/terraform-gcp/Advance/import$ terraform import google_compute_instance.existing-vm projects/neat-glazing-473202-f3/zo
nes/us-central1-c/instances/gcp-terraform-practice
google_compute_instance.existing-vm: Importing from ID "projects/neat-glazing-473202-f3/zones/us-central1-c/instances/gcp-terraform-practice"...
google_compute_instance.existing-vm: Import prepared!
  Prepared google_compute_instance for import
google_compute_instance.existing-vm: Refreshing state... [id=projects/neat-glazing-473202-f3/zones/us-central1-c/instances/gcp-terraform-practice]

Import successful!

The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.

```

---

### **3. Verify the import**

Run:

```bash
terraform state list
```

You‚Äôll see something like:

```
google_compute_instance.existing_vm
```

Then check its attributes:

```bash
terraform state show google_compute_instance.existing_vm
```

---

### **4. Populate configuration (optional)**

Now Terraform knows about your resource in the state file.
If you want to fully manage it (e.g., plan or apply later), you can copy values from the state output into your `main.tf` file.

Example:

```bash
terraform state show google_compute_instance.existing_vm > state.txt
```

Then extract important fields and update `main.tf` accordingly.

---

### **5. Validate the import**

Once you update your config, run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

If it shows **‚ÄúNo changes‚Äù**, you‚Äôve successfully imported and reconciled the resource.

‚úÖ **Summary of the flow (same as AWS):**

| Step | Command                     | Purpose                               |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Define empty resource block | Create a placeholder in config        |
| 2    | `terraform import`          | Link state with existing GCP resource |
| 3    | `terraform state show`      | Inspect actual attributes             |
| 4    | Update main.tf              | Match configuration to reality        |
| 5    | `terraform plan`            | Confirm everything aligns             |

Would you like me to give you **3 import practice tasks** for GCP (e.g., VM, storage bucket, and firewall) ‚Äî just like a mini-lab you can run on your account?
It‚Äôll be perfect prep for interviews.
